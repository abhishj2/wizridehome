<h2 class="section-title animate-on-scroll">1. Types of Permits Required for Foreign Tourists</h2>
        <p class="animate-on-scroll">To enter and explore various parts of Sikkim, foreign nationals must obtain specific permits. These permits are categorized based on the areas you wish to visit and the activities you plan to undertake. Below are the two primary permits you’ll need:
        </p>

        <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Restricted Area Permit (RAP)</h3>
        <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is mandatory for all foreign nationals (except citizens of Bhutan) who wish to visit Sikkim. This permit is issued free of cost and is valid for <strong> 30 days</strong>, with the possibility of extending your stay up to <strong>60 days</strong>.

        <ul class="points animate-on-scroll">
          <li><strong>Key Rule:</strong> The RAP is not granted to foreign tourists traveling alone. You must be part of a group consisting of at least two or more people to apply for this permit.</li>
<li><strong>Registration Requirement:</strong> Within 24 hours of arriving in Sikkim, foreign tourists must register with the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) in Gangtok. Failure to do so may result in penalties or deportation.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Protected Area Permit (PAP)</h3>
          <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Protected Area Permit (PAP) is necessary for visits to high-altitude and sensitive areas such as Tsomgo Lake, Lachen, Lachung, Yumthang Valley, Thangu, and other northern regions.</p>
          <ul class="points animate-on-scroll">
            
          <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Unlike the RAP, the PAP cannot be obtained individually. It must be arranged through a registered travel agency or tour operator. Additionally, PAP applications require a minimum group size of two people.</li>

          <li><strong>Validity:</strong> The duration of the PAP depends on the itinerary and is issued for a day excursion for Tsomgo Lake and for a minimum of 3 days & 2 nights to a maximum of 5 days & 4 nights for Lachen/Lachung/Yumthang/Thangu in North Sikkim.</li>
